            Void is meant to be a language that makes the jobs of developers easier by a ton.
            It's purpose is to be able to write clean and efficient code at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, according to my years of coding experience, mostly what I can see is, that 
            you have to decide, whether you want to write good looking, simple design, easily maintainable 
            code, or you want to make it run fast.
            I wanted to make a language that could do both.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took heavy inspirations from popular languages, such as Java, C#, Rust, Golang, Kotlin, Dart.
            I tried to include the useful features of those, that people are already used to, as well as 
            coming up with my own ideas, how to enchant programming experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Void is not really a beginner-friendly language I must admit, as much of its concepts are 
            dependant on higher knowledge of programming. However, I believe that it would 
            be still a lot easier to learn Void first, than many other languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Void tries to do all the hard work under the hood, so you don't have to explicitly
            do all kinds of memory management and safety ensuring. Therefore, you could say Void
            is indeed considered a high-level language. Even though that it is generally true, Void
            ensures to include as much as possible unsafe low-level access at for experienced programmers.
            This way people can explore the similar power that C gives you, that you can have control
            over everything, at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            Void has been a passion of mine for a long time now. 
            I've been working on it since I was about 16 years old.
            The syntax has changed a lot every since, as well as the entire program being rewritten
            many times to this day. I am looking forward to improve Void as time goes, planning to
            make it a good choice for whether production or personal use.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that you are going to have a great experience using Void.
            I wish you the best of luck widening your programming knowledge, and exploring something new.
            Have fun learning it and welcome to the Void community.
