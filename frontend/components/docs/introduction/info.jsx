        <h2>What is Void?</h2>
        <p>
            Void is a general-purpose programing language designed for developers to be able to create clean, 
            fast and stable multi-platform applications.
            It has has a relatively easy syntax, that follows most of the already existing code conventions.
            Void features many utilities that enchant the experience of coding, such as object destruction, 
            variable redeclaration, multi-returning, and much more.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Void?</h2>
        <p>
            Void compiles to bytecode, therefore it allows the application with the same exact code, 
            to be ran on all platforms, whilst forward and backward compatibility is guaranteed. 
            It has many built-in designs, which makes it much easier to develop enterprise-grade applications.
        </p>
        <h2>How to use Void?</h2>
        <p>
            Void is designed to satisfy the needs of multiple development paradigms. 
            Unlike many production-oriented languages, Void does not force object-oriented programming on you, 
            however it is recommended to use in most cases.
